After years of intense competition and rigorous training, **Dr Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor was selected as Malaysia's first angkasawan, with Dr Faiz Khaleed as backup.**

Out of more than 11,000 applicants, the PAN selection process narrowed candidates through physical tests, medical evaluations, survival training with PASKAL commandos, psychological assessments, and months of cosmonaut training in Star City, Russia. The program highlighted Malaysia's commitment to scientific excellence and national pride.

## Quarantine at Baikonur
In early October 2007, Dr. Sheikh Muszaphar, and Dr Faiz Khaleed, were placed under strict quarantine at Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Only medical and training officials were allowed contact to ensure optimal health. 

During quarantine, the astronauts repeated take-off procedures, emergency drills, and routines to adapt to the ISS schedule. Meal and sleep times followed Greenwich Mean Time (GMT): sleeping at 8 PM GMT meant 4 AM in Malaysia. A 24-hour communication blackout was enforced before launch. Personal messages from the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Prime Minister, and Deputy Prime Minister were delivered only after docking at the ISS.

## The Soyuz TMA-11 Spacecraft
The Soyuz TMA-11 rocket, adorned with the Malaysian flag (Jalur Gemilang) and coat of arms (Jata Negara), was transported from assembly to the launch pad. Russian engineers applied finishing touches, including installation of the emergency rescue system.

Dr. Sheikh Muszaphar familiarized himself with his custom-fitted space suit, designed for comfort, safety, and to manage waste during ascent. Despite the rocket's 50-meter height, the interior was cramped. The crew would spend over 24 hours inside before reaching the ISS, strapped into individually fitted lounge seats.

## The Crew: A Historic Trio
The Soyuz TMA-11 carried a three-person crew with one nationality per seat:
* **Dr Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor (Malaysia) :**  medical officer, Malaysia's first astronaut
* **Yuri Malenchenko (Russia):**  veteran cosmonaut on his third long-duration mission
* **Peggy Whitson (USA) :**  first woman to command the ISS

Sheikh Muszaphar's presence marked a historic milestone for Malaysia. Whitson's leadership and Malenchenko's experience provided stability for the mission.

## Countdown and Nationwide Excitement
At 21:21 Malaysian time (19:20 Kazakhstan time) on 10 October 2007, Soyuz TMA-11 lifted off from Baikonur. Malaysians watched via live broadcast by TV3, with support from Astro and Celcom. Crowds gathered at Dataran Merdeka, while VVIPs including the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister watched from KLCC. MRSM students from Muar (Dr. Sheikh Muszaphar's former secondary school) and other schools in KLCC joined the live viewing.

The crowd joined a national countdown: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Early technical difficulties arose when the big screen at Dataran Merdeka failed, but it was quickly resolved. The excitement was palpable. Chant "Malaysia Ku Gemilang" echoed across the plaza.

## Inside the Capsule
TV3 narrated moments from microgravity: 

> "It shows the pen of the cosmonaut is starting to float." 

Live footage revealed objects moving weightlessly, illustrating the unusual environment Dr. Sheikh Muszaphar would experience aboard the ISS.

## Insights from NASA
Captain Robert Gibson from NASA, visiting Malaysia, shared his perspective. He explained what Dr. Sheikh Muszaphar might have been feeling 20 minutes before launch. Gibson noted that the Soyuz Dr. Sheikh Muszaphar was riding was an improved version and speculated that Dr. Sheikh Muszaphar would want to return to space in the future.

During his visit, he engaged with Malaysian school and university students over a span of 10–11 days, while Sheikh conducted experiments aboard the ISS. He stated that his objective was to inspire Malaysian youth with a passion for science, technology, and space exploration.

## Mission Objectives and Docking
The crew's destination, the International Space Station, awaited them. Soyuz TMA-11 docked just over 24 hours after launch. 

Personal messages from Malaysian leaders were delivered, connecting Sheikh Muszaphar with his homeland. He immediately began biomedical experiments exploring microgravity effects, space radiation studies on cells and microbes, and protein research for potential HIV vaccine development. Special provisions allowed him to perform prayers while observing Ramadan, adapting to microgravity.

From Dataran Merdeka to KLCC, the nation watched history unfold. Despite minor glitches, the day showcased Malaysia's scientific ambition, resilience, and unity. Sheikh Muszaphar's journey was more than a personal achievement ;  it was a moment of national pride, inspiration, and proof that even a young spacefaring nation can contribute meaningfully to global science.
